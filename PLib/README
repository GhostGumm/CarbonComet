### Unix users (Ubuntu, Arch ...) ###

# install dependencies (supposing you have curl already)
sudo apt-get install libjansson-dev

# generate autohell files
./bootstrap_autohell

# now you can run ./configure && make 
# optionally ./configure --prefix=/path/to/my/folder if you don't want to install to /usr/local
# make install



### For Mac OSX Users ###

#install dependencies
brew install libjansson-dev

brew install curl

#generate autohell files
./bootstrap_autohell
autoreconf -i (if you face the ltmain.sh is missing error)

# now you can run ./configure && make
# optionally ./configure --prefix=/path/to/my/folder if you don't want to install to /usr/local
# make install
(if make doesn't run due to a missing jansson.h even if included, add the path to the jansson.h folder(not file) in AM_CFLAGS(/src/Makefile line : 344) Eg :  -I/usr/local/Cellar/jansson/2.7/include and it will run fine)
Also if doesn't make due to a unsigned expression comparison, just erase the -Werror flag in AM_CFLAGS(/src/Makefile line 344) it will generate a warning but run smooth).
